## Lumpfish Husbandry
R tools for analysing acoustic tag data from processed HTI-Vemco acoustic tag files.  
These tools were developed for analysing an acoustic dataset from acoustic tagged lumpfish in salmon net pens.  
Output files from raw acoustic data processing should be in .csv format with standard HTI acoustic file headers.   

1. AcousticTagProcessLumphus - combine, split and rearrange acoustic tag files.
2. AcousticTagCodeLumphus - code farm data, farm events and environmental data, and calculate various values from acoustic position data.
3. AcousticTagAnalyseLumphus - Analysis and visualisation tools for acoustic data from cleaner fish in salmon net pens.
